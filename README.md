**Objective**

To build a responsive website using HTML and CSS that will showcase my
professional portfolio, which will include the projects I’ll build throughout
my Full-Stack Web Development Program.

This website is available online at https://coderzeroone.com/

**The 5 W’s**

- **Who?** My professional network, as well as potential employers. The website will be
for anyone interested in my professional work and who might want to contact me
about it.
- **What?** A responsive portfolio website built with HTML and CSS.
- **When?** The website might be visited when a potential employer is checking my
previous experience; or, after I’ve met a professional contact and they want to see
what I'am up to.
- **Where?** Potential employers might look at the website from their offices, while
networking contacts might access it from their mobile phones (e.g., after meeting
me).
- **Why?** For my potential employers, clients, or collaborators to learn more about my
professional experience and relevant skills, as well as how to reach me. The site will
also demonstrate my frontend development skills to employers.

**Key Features**

- A **homepage** with a short introduction and links to work examples
- An **about page** with key information about me as an individual, my relevant skills,
and the tools or programming languages I use
- A section with my work examples — either as part of your homepage (e.g., in a grid)
or on a separate **portfolio page**

separate **contact page**
